# AddressBook-4  This app has evolved from the previous apps with the same name to now utilize an HTML form which the user can click a button
called "List" that will display a list of all the entries in the Address Book.
When the user clicks the "List" button the command goes to the AddressBookServlet where the ArrayList "fList" is called from the UserDB class
which accessess the "Contacts" SQL database to fill the ArrayList. That information is then passed to the JSP which uses the information to
fill an HTML table which is then displayed for the user to see.
I added some CSS to the HTML table to enhance it.
